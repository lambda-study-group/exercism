# Anagram

Welcome to Anagram on Exercism's Pharo Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word.
Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

As with Isogram, it's worth browsing what data types are already available in the system. Also remember to take the tests step by step and try to build up a solution bit by bit. The debugger can also be your friend, and remember that it's possible to evaluate any expression or variable to better visualise and and understand how it works.
