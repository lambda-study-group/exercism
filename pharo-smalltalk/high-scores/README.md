# High Scores

Welcome to High Scores on Exercism's Pharo Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

This is a nice exercise to just test drive (TDD), and let each test guide your solution
