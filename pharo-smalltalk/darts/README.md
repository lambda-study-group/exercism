# Darts

Welcome to Darts on Exercism's Pharo Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

[Darts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts) is a game where players
throw darts to a [target](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darts#/media/File:Darts_in_a_dartboard.jpg).

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards with 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

* If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
* If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
* If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
* If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (This is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered to the same point (That is, the circles are [concentric](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConcentricCircles.html)) defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its `real` cartesian coordinates `x` and `y`), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing in that point.

The Pythagorean theorum will help.
