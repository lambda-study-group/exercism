# Isogram

Welcome to Isogram on Exercism's Pharo Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

There is a range of interesting data types in Pharo, it's worth taking the time to browse the  hierarchy of class Collection and reading some of the class comments and running some of the examples.
