# Two Fer

Welcome to Two Fer on Exercism's F# Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## Instructions

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```text
One for name, one for me.
```

Where "name" is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

|Name    |String to return
|:-------|:------------------
|Alice   |One for Alice, one for me.
|Bob     |One for Bob, one for me.
|        |One for you, one for me.
|Zaphod  |One for Zaphod, one for me.
